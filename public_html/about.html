          <strong><p class="pprice">CANADA'S PREMIER CAT BOUTIQUE</p></strong>
          <p class="pstyle">Kitty Lover is a small family-owned boutique located in the heart of the Glebe in Ottawa. We specialize in cats, carrying quality cat care items, a selection of the finest cat foods, and hundreds of different cat toys that will excite even the most unimpressible feline.

While you're here, don't forget to spend a few minutes cuddling Mokey, our C.E.O.!</p>

          <br><p class="pstyle">After graduating college, Spencer Williams knew what he had to do. Before settling on a career, he needed to return to his home state of Montana (he even told his wife this on their first date). So after a stint selling financial software on the East Coast, they packed their bags and headed west.  

With the intention of creating something that brings joy to people's lives, Spencer (at age 23) bought a small cut-and-sew pet toy company in Livingston, MT. "I grew up on a ranch and so animals always had a special place in my heart - especially for stray dogs and cats. " So with less than 5 full-time employees, and an impressive team of home-sewers, Spencer set out to conquer the world of pet toys - one ounce of organic catnip at a time.</p>
